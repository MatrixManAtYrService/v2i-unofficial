\tableofcontents

The UTC plugin is the source of Universal Coordinated Time for plugin modules installed 
on the IVP platform.  Depending on the configuration of the UTC plugin, the time source 
for the system’s local time is synchronized with either timestamps from an installed GPS 
receiver, or from a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server, in the case that no GPS receiver 
is available and the IVP platform has a reliable source of internet connectivity.

Regardless of the source of the system’s local time, the UTC plugin extracts the local 
server time and formats it into several messages that are published to the IVP Message Router.

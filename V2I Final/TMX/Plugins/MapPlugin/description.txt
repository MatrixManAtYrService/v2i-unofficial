The MAP Plugin publishes a Battelle SPaT MAP Message containing data to describe 
complex intersections, curve outlines, and roadway segments which are used 
by a variety of other J2735 messages.

\section mapdesign Design

The MAP Plugin reads a local xml file, which is controlled by a configuration parameter, to create the 
Battelle SPaT MAP message that is sent to the IVP system.  The xml file format is described in the 
XXXXXX document.  The XMLMapParser class contains methods to read the xml file, parse the data from
the xml file, and populate a map structure.  The map structure is encoded into bytes, which are the payload
of the Battelle SPaT MAP message.  That payload is sent as a hex string in a json formatted IVP Message to the 
IVP system and eventually out the DSRC radio.  The MAP plugin receives action information from the Traffic 
Signal Controller plugin, and loads different map xml information based on the configuration pairing of 
action to map file in the configuration.  If the action number in the configuration is set to -1, 
that map is used for all actions.  If an action number is missing from the confiugration, the default map
xml files is used.

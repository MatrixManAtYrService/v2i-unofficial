The Position Correction Provider supplies the IVP Communication Hub with real time differential 
GPS correction data, using an Ntrip (Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol) client to 
receive differential GPS data over the internet in RTCM format.

The Position Correction Plugin receives correction information over an internet connection after 
supplying the Position Correction Provider its current location information.  The position correction 
information is converted into a J2735 RTCM message and published to the IVP Message Router.  The 
Position Correction Plugin may also receive J2735 RTCM Messages from the IVP Message Router, and if 
the source of those messages is not itself, the Position Correction Plugin will stop asking for position 
correction data from the Position Correction Provider until the RTCM messages stop.  This strategy allows 
the IVP platform to act either as a publisher or subscriber of position correction data as dictated by the 
local environment.
